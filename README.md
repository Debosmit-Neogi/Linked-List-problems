# Linked-List-problems

This repository contains important questions of linked lists from interview point of view.

## Problem 1. Add one to number:
You are given a linked list representing a number such that each individual node acts as a digit of the number. The list HEAD->1->2->3->NULL corresponds to the number 123. Your task is to add 1 to this number. Return 1->2->4->NULL

## Problem 2. Reverse Linked list- iterative approach
You are given a linked list. Reverse the linked list and print it using iterative approach

## Problem 3. Reverse Linked list- recursive approach
You are given a linked list. Reverse the linked list and print it using recursive approach

## Problem 4. Reverse k nodes of linked list
Given a linked list, write a function to reverse every k nodes (where k is an input to the function). 
Example: 
Input: 1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->NULL,  (K = 3)    Output: 3->2->1->6->5->4->8->7->NULL 

## Problem 5. Detect loop in a linked list
Given a linked list, check if the linked list has loop or not.
Example:

Input: 1-2-3   Output: Loop is present
         | | 
         5-4
